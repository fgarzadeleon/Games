# Giant's Causeway

## Objective

As we build the Giant’s Causeway, the stones will start stacking on top of each other. Once a player has built 3 towers of 3 stones the game ends.

## Setup

Place 3 stones of each with the blank side up in the following configuration.

Then starting with the white stones place a Giant in any free spot adjacent to any of the stones already on the board. Then the player with the black stones places their giant.

We are ready to begin.

## How a giant moves

A giant can move in 3 ways:

1. Step: Place a stone under a giant and move into an adjacent empty space.

2. Run: Move to any other position in the causeway adhering to restrictions.

	**Restrictions:**
	The Causeway cannot break apart in two. A giant cannot move into a position it cannot slide through.

3. Leap: Move over any number of stones on straight path of adjacent stones until an empty space. The Giant drops stones on top of the stones it moved over. If jumping over a tower of 3, no further stones are dropped on top.

	**Warning:**
	This action cannot be taken if in any of the adjacent there is a spell stone of the other player’s colour.

If leaping (movement 3) and a tower of 3 stones is created then the tower is either scored or destroyed according to these rules:

a.     If the top stone forms a majority of stones in the tower, then that player receives a point. That is if 2 or 3 stones in the tower are of the topmost colour, that colour gets a point. The tower stays on the board.
	
b. If the top stone is not the majority colour in the stack, then all stones except the top stone are removed and the top stone is turned around to show the spell face of the stone, this is now a spell stone.

## Endgame:

Once a player has scored three towers they win. It is recommended that you swap colours and play a second round with starter player swapped.

## Quick variant:

Play to 3 towers and no spell stones, if (3b) happens that tower stays instead of turning into a spell stone. Whoever has the most stones in towers wins (9 stones total, 5 needed for majority).
