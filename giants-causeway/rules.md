# Giant's Causeway

## Objective

As we build the Giant’s Causeway, the pieces will start stacking on top of each other. Once a player has built 3 towers of 3 pieces the game ends.

## Setup

Place 3 pieces of each with the blank side up in the following configuration.

Then starting with the white pieces place a Giant in any free spot adjacent to any of the pieces already on the board. Then the player with the black pieces places their giant.

We are ready to begin.

## How a giant moves

A giant can move in 3 ways:

1. Place a piece under a giant and move into an empty space.

2. Move to any other position in the causeway adhering to restrictions.

	**Restrictions:**
	The Causeway cannot break apart in two. A giant cannot move into a position it cannot slide through.

3. Move over any number of pieces on straight path of adjacent pieces until an empty space. The Giant drops pieces on top of the pieces it moved over. A spot can never have more than 3 pieces on top of each other. 

	**Warning:**
	This action cannot be taken if in any of the adjacent there is a spell of the other player’s colour.

If action (3) is taken and a tower of 3 pieces is created then the tower is either scored or destroyed according to these rules:

a.     If the top piece is the majority colour in the stack, then that is scored as 1 tower of the three needed to win. The tower stays on the board.
	
b. If the top piece is no the majority colour in the stack, then all pieces except the top piece are removed and the top piece is turned around to show the spell face of the piece.

## Endgame:

Once a player has scored three towers they win. It is recommended that you swap colours and play a second round with starter player swapped.

## Quick variant:

Play to 3 towers and no spells, if (3b) happens that tower stays instead of turning into a spell. Whoever has the most pieces in towers wins (9 pieces total, 5 needed for majority).
