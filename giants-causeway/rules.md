* Player Count: 2
* Approx. playing time: 15 minutes
* Ages: 8-99

## Introduction

Players take on the role of mythical giants, taking turns to move and leap around the causeway, adding stones and building towers. The first player to build 3 towers of their own wins the game.
Components

52 stones:

* 4 Giants (2 white, 2 black)
* 6 Barrier stones (3 white, 3 black)
* 42 blank stones (21 white, 21 black)

## Setup

Place the 2 blank stones in the following arrangement:

Assign the white stones to one player and the black stones to the other player.

In alternating turn order starting with white, each player place their 2 Giant stones and a blank stones adjacent to any piece already placed. A giant may not be placed in a position where it is only adjacent to another giant.



## How to play

The white player goes first. Players then take alternating turns.

The setup might create a game that looks the following way: 

![](images/step-1.png)

On your turn, you must choose one of your Giants and either Step or Leap:

### 1. Step
----
Take a blank stone of your colour from the supply and place it under your Giant. Then place the Giant in **any other position** adjacent to at least one stone in the Causeway. This includes positions that may be completely surrounded by stones or Giants.

*Player A has stepped into the position shown above by a blue arrow. The board now looks like this:*

**Trapping your opponent**
If you place your Giant so that it is adjacent to an opponent’s Giant and not adjacent to any other stone in the Causeway, you have trapped the opponent’s Giant.

**Escaping a trap**
If your Giant is **trapped**, you can only step to a new position adjacent to the new blank stone you just placed.

### 2. Leap
----
Jump your Giant in a straight path over any number of connected stones or stacks of stones and place it in the first empty space it reaches.

You **cannot** leap if you are trapped or if it would break the causeway in two.

You **cannot** leap over any Giants or one of their Barrier stones (see Completing Towers).

**Dropping stones and building Towers**

When you leap, you must drop 1 or 2 stones of your own colour, taken from the supply, onto 1 or 2 of the stones you leap over. When you drop a stone over another, you create a Tower.

When you drop the third stone in the Tower you have create either completed a Tower or created Barrier.

When you leap you **cannot** drop a stone over a Tower with 3 stones in it.

You **cannot** choose to drop 0 stones or more than 2 stones. If you drop 2 stones, you must drop them onto separate Towers. If there is no legal position to drop a stone you may leap without placing stones.

**Completing Towers**

If you drop a third stone onto a Tower you have completed it:

If the other two stones in the Tower belong to your opponent, remove the stone you just dropped and replace it with one of your Barrier stones. You have blocked your opponent from claiming the Tower for themself. If you have already placed all three of your Spellstones, you must move one of them from another Tower.

If at least one of the other two stones in the Tower is yours, you have won the Tower. Leave all the stones in it in place.

## End of the game

The first player to win three Towers wins the game.

If no player has three Towers and one player runs out of pieces the game is over. The player without pieces must destroy a Tower. After that whoever has the most Towers wins.

In the case that both players are tied in number of Towers then the player with the most Barrier stones wins.
