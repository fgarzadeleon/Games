# Giant's Causeway

## Objective

As we build the Giantâ€™s Causeway, the stones will start stacking on top of each other. Once a player has built 3 towers of 3 stones the game ends.

## Setup and Game Order

Place 3 stones of each with the blank side up in the following configuration.

Then in turns and starting with the white stones place a giant in any free spot adjacent to any of the stones already on the board. Then the player with the black stones places their giant. Then the player with the white stones places their last giant followed by the player with the black stones.

Once all giants have been placed we are ready to begin with white moving a giant.

## Pieces
E
Each player will have: 
* A spikey giant
* A trapper giant
* Three spellstonses
* 20 blank stones

The *trapper* giant can prevent an adjacent giant to move and a *spikey* giant does not allow giants to leap on top of it. Spellstones prevent the movement of giants in specific ways.

## How a giant moves

A giant can move in 2 ways:

1. Step: Place a stone under a giant and move into any empty space whilst adhering to the restrictions of movement.

	**Restrictions:**
	The Causeway cannot break apart in two. A giant cannot move into a position it cannot slide through. If you are trapped by a *trapper* giant you can not use the Step action and need to use the escape action.
	
2. Escape:

3. Leap: Move over any number of stones on straight path of adjacent stones until an empty space. The giant must drop one stone or two stones over the stones it leaped over. You may only place one stone per stone you leaped over. The choice of where in the path to drop stones is upto the player. If jumping over a tower of 3 stones or a spellstone, no further stones are dropped on top.

	**Warning:**
	Giants cannot leap over any *spikey* giant, no matter their colour, or the spellstone of the opposing player (i.e. you can leap over your own spellstones but not your own *spikey* giant).

## Scoring

If leaping (movement 3) and a tower of 3 stones is created then the tower is either scored or destroyed according to these rules:

**a.**     If the top stone forms a majority of stones in the tower, then that player has scored the tower, that is if 2 or 3 stones in the tower are of the topmost colour, that player is on step closer to winning. The tower stays on the board.
	
**b.** If the top stone is not the majority colour in the stack, then replace the current top stone with a spellstone. This stack now has a spell and a rival giant cannot leap over it

**Warning:**
	A player may only ever have at most three spell stones in play. if condition 3b. may happen the new spell stone must be created and an older spell stone chose to turn around.

## Endgame:

Once a player has three towers of three stones, they win. It is recommended that you swap colours and play a second round with starter player swapped.

## Setup variants:

## Quick variant:

Play to 3 towers and no spell stones, if (3b) happens that tower stays instead of turning into a spell stone. Whoever has the most stones in towers wins (9 stones total, 5 needed for majority).
