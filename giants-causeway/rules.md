# Giant's Causeway

## Objective

As we build the Giant’s Causeway, the stones will start stacking on top of each other. Once a player has built 3 towers of 3 stones the game ends.

## Setup

Place 3 stones of each with the blank side up in the following configuration.

Then in turns and starting with the white stones place a giant in any free spot adjacent to any of the stones already on the board. Then the player with the black stones places their giant. Then the player with the white stones places their last giant followed by the player with the black stones.

Once all giants have been placed we are ready to begin.

## Pieces

Each player has 2 giants and three spellstones. Spellstones prevent the movement of giants in specific ways. The *trapping* giant can prevent an adjacent giant to move and a *spikey* giant does not allow giants to leap on top of it.

## How a giant moves

A giant can move in 2 ways:

1. Step: Place a stone under a giant and move into any adjacent empty space whilst adhering to the restrictions of movement.

	**Restrictions:**
	The Causeway cannot break apart in two. A giant cannot move into a position it cannot slide through.

2. Leap: Move over any number of stones on straight path of adjacent stones until an empty space. The Giant drops a maximum of two stones on top of the stones it leaped over. If jumping over a tower of 3, no further stones are dropped on top.

	**Warning:**
	Giant's cannot leap over each others spell stones or *spikey* giants. This action cannot be taken if there is a spell stone of the other player’s colour along the path

If leaping (movement 3) and a tower of 3 stones is created then the tower is either scored or destroyed according to these rules:

**a.**     If the top stone forms a majority of stones in the tower, then that player has scored the tower, that is if 2 or 3 stones in the tower are of the topmost colour, that player is on step closer to winning. The tower stays on the board.
	
**b.** If the top stone is not the majority colour in the stack, then replace the current top stone with a spellstone. This stack now has a spell and a rival giant cannot leap over it

**Warning:**
	A player may only ever have at most three spell stones in play. if condition 3b. may happen the new spell stone must be created and an older spell stone chose to turn around.

## Endgame:

Once a player has three towers of three stones, they win. It is recommended that you swap colours and play a second round with starter player swapped.

## Quick variant:

Play to 3 towers and no spell stones, if (3b) happens that tower stays instead of turning into a spell stone. Whoever has the most stones in towers wins (9 stones total, 5 needed for majority).
