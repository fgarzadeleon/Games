## Events

Event Name | How? | Points 
----- | ---------- | ---- 
**100 metres**| Short track with flicks moving you forwards whilst remaining in your lane or you need to place your disc back where you started and add the flick to your tally (I guess like golf). Possible inury management mechanism flicking too far succesfully causes you injuries, flicking too short causes you to fall behind and flicking out of lane makes you lose that flick. | Less Flicks more points
**Long Jump**| Three flicks to reach jump line point then large flick to reach longest point without coming out the track. Best of three tries. | Determined by position
**Shot put** | Flip a disc from the side of the table and land on the game board and reach furthest point possible. Not landing on the board is a miss. Three attemps only| Determined by position
**High jump** | Place a disc at edge of the table and flip over a pole. Three tries to achieve height then the pole goes up.|Determined by height
**400 metres**| Similar to 100 metres longer track. Possibly injury management comes back to play here.|Less Flicks more points
**100 metres hurdles**|Tall discs that you flick like in the 100 metre race but when you reach a hurdle a flipable disc is place on top to cross the hurdle| 20-Flicks-Penalties from hurdles
**Discus throw**|Discs thrown from a platform (like Frisbee Golf Tabletop game)  on a very small track and be the one to reach furthest point. Three attempts only.|Distance
**Pole vault**|Place a thin flipable disc on top of a taller disc and flip over the pole target. Challenge how high can you? Three tries per height. |Height
**Javeling throw**|Roll a coin like disc down the board, best of three tries.|Distance
