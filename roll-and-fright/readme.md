# Roll and Fright  
2 Player | 20 mins

A game of dueling halloween tactics to snatch as much candy as you can before all the houses have been hit!

You'll need four coloured dice, two pens and a copy of the printout sheet.


This was a submission to the #autumndice roll and write competition, check out some of the other brilliant games [over there](https://sites.google.com/view/rollandwriteglobaljam/home).
